<strong> 1. The Labryinth Garden :- </strong>
<br><br>
Special Features of the Retreat is Meditation at the Labryinth Garden.
<br><br>
A Unique Experience- Meditation at Labryrinth garden
<br><br>
Labyrinth Meditation
<br>
The Labyrinth Garden, a pathway to healing, was inaugurated at 5:30 pm by Fr. Prashant. He led the entire group in a healing meditative walk. Healing can be a delicate endeavor, discovering and utilizing a space to be able to prayerfully reflect and recover. This landscape is designed to provide a quiet area for meditation and personal transformation. At the entrance to the labyrinth is a “Chalice Space,” which is the first stop on the healing journey. The meditator is helped to get ready to walk mindfully and surrender oneself to the hidden mystery of life and death. Natural elements of stones and green cactus remind us that life is peaceful, with a combination of roses and thorns. The cross at the center reminds each meditator that ultimately we journey with our cross together with Jesus. Quite a few gave testimonies of spiritual experiences while walking the Labyrinth. A couple of people felt a sense of healing.

A walk through the Medical Garden provides an opportunity to reflect on Gods provision on healing through His creation.
