   <strong> Devotion to Mother Mary </strong> is an important feature of all spiritual exercise on the Lords Ranch… The statue of the Blessed Virgin Mother Mary which was placed in the present grotto on <strong> 31st December, 2006 </strong> has an amazing story as to how it arrived on the Lords Ranch as we see from the testimony given below.

   <br>
   The statue of the Blessed Mother arrived at the Lords Ranch started off with a vision. <strong> Olive Pinto </strong> had a vision of Mother Mary with only the face of Jesus with a crown of thorns on His head. Every time she closed her eyes in prayer, Mother Mary asked Olive to take a statue of her to the Lords Ranch. She tried to ignore the message. <br> <br>

Olive was new to the Charismatic movement and had just joined the Bible Study that was conducted by Br. Hillary Da Veiga, the message became clearer each day. Olive was terrified of approaching <strong> Br. Hillary,</strong> so, she decided to ask the person who assisted Br. Hillary to advise what he thought about it. <br><br>

The assistant told Olive that it was a vision and that she needs to personally tell Br. Hillary about it. After much prayer it was decided to carry out this vision. Mother Mary gave specific instructions of the size, color, how her hands were to be placed. This was thoroughly executed by a nun who gave Olive all the assistance she needed to carry out her mission. <br><br>

Olive asked Mother Mary where in the Lords Ranch she was supposed to place her and Mother Mary said it was insignificant. When Olive visited the Lords Ranch for the first time, it was massive place with nothing except for a small shed and so she chose a plateau and placed her on a flat rock at the edge of a cliff so that people could see her from far and near. It was a marathon task to transport the statue from Bombay on a road that was rough and bumpy. Only with the Mighty power from the Lord, Olive took the statue safely to the Ranch. With praise and thanksgiving, Olive and her family travelled and reached the top of the Ranch. On <strong> 20th April 2004,</strong> the blessing of the statue, and the first mass was said at the Lords Ranch. All praise and glory to Jesus our Saviour. <br><br>

Throughout the years of struggle as the work of getting the infrastructure of the Lords ranch in place from road to construction work and residences, Mother Mary’s statue was there on the Ranch.
Mary our Mother stood by interceding for the Lords mighty protection on the place and the workforce over there. The present grotto was blessed by <strong> Bishop Lourdes Daniel on 31st Dec. 2006.</strong> And since then through Mother Mary’s intercession lives have been touched, transformed and mighty healings have flown in the lives of many who have come to the Ranch.

<strong> Anthony’s Testimony :- </strong>
<br>

At the very dawn of <strong> January 1st 2007 </strong>, Mother Mary touches the lives and transforms a young man addicted to satanic music, laying for the foundation of mighty graces that began to flow on the youth ever since.

<strong> A mighty healing in front of the grotto -   Adelyne Da Veiga </strong>

As a result of a fall I had damaged some knee ligaments on both my knees. Despite all treatment I could walk very slowly practically counting my steps. I could not kneel and I used to get severe pains on and off that completely mobilised my left leg. In August 2007 we were in Goa. We were travelling by bus from Goa to Pune myself, my son and a friend of his. Barely an hour after we boarded the bus I got this severe pain in my leg. I could not imagine how I would go though the journey Somehow by God’s mighty Grace I reached Pune and then on to the Ranch. The vehicle stopped and knowing the excruciating pain I was in my son came to help me out of the vehicle. The moment I put my foot down on the ground, to my great surprise there was no pain. I looked up to see that the location was exactly opposite the statue of Mother Mary in the Grotto. There was no pain and everyone around me noticed I was walking normally.
